All credits go to Dyno! He's wrote a very small (4KB) game, and I honestly ruined some parts of it. By including EVERY library it requires and image files I managed to squeeze everything into less than 64KB, and I think with some more arcane arts of JS stripping I think it could go even smaller.

This is just a silly thing I made, please don't take it seriously.
