All credits go to Dyno! He's wrote a very small (4KB) game, and I honestly ruined some parts of it. By including EVERY library it requires and image files I managed to squeeze everything into less than 64KB, and I think with some more arcane arts of JS stripping I think it could go even smaller.

This is just a silly thing I "made", please don't take it seriously.

p.s. There used to be a soundtrack but I just couldn't make it work with data stream so I had to take it out.
